## About
This project was created during McGill University's [COMP361D1](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/comp-361d1) and [COMP361D2](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/comp-361d2) courses in 2022-2023. Our goal is to bring Marc Andr√©'s popular board game "Splendor" into computer as an online multiplayer game. We have also included the expansions "Orient," "Trading Post," and "City" to enhance the gaming experience.
